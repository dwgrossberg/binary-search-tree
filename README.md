# binary-search-tree

A JavaScript module that builds a balanced binary search tree from an array of numbers.

`Tree(array)` returns a balanced binary search tree (BST) with numerous methods available for use. These include:

- `insetVal(val)` & `deleteVal(val)` accept values and either add or remove them to the BST
- `find(node)` accepts a node and returns the node with the given value
- `levelOrder()` traverses the tree in breadth-first level order and prints each node's data
- `preOrder()`, `inOrder()`, and `postOrder()` each traverse the tree in their respective depth-first order and print the data to the console
-

Written via a TDD approach, using Jest.

Created as part of The Odin Project's Computer Science course on Binary Search Trees
